# Koru

## Description

Koru connects you to the Māori concept of growth and renewal, inviting daily reflections to foster gratitude and mindfulness.

Koru is a spiral shape that reflects the unfurling of a silver fern frond. It symbolizes new life, growth, strength, and peace—qualities that can be cultivated through the practice of gratitude.

Here's what it looks like:

## Why Koru?

Koru was inspired by my personal journey through difficult times. During this period, I discovered the transformative power of gratitude through books and my own journal, where I recorded three things I was grateful for each day.

This practice shifted my mindset, fostering positivity, hope, and happiness. I realized that gratitude is a powerful tool for enhancing our lives. My goal is to provide a space where individuals can connect with their own experiences, find joy in the small moments, and embrace the journey of growth and renewal. Together, we can harness the strength of gratitude to enhance our lives in meaningful ways.
